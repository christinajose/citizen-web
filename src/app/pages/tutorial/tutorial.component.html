            <p>Individual tree detection is critical in forest monitoring and inventory. In this paper, we propose a
                novel method to use multi-view satellite images to detect individual trees and delineate their crowns.
                As compared to previous methods, we generate the DSM from the multi-view high-resolution satellite
                images and combine the 2D spectral and 3D structure information to detect the trees. Firstly, the
                vegetation areas are extracted to remove the non-vegetation objects while terrain areas are extracted to
                help calculate the tree height. Then, we utilize Top-Hat morphological operation to efficiently find the
                local maxima points as treetops and further refine them by checking their heights and doing non-maximal
                suppression. Finally, we use a super-pixel segmentation algorithm to delineate the tree crowns which
                considered both 2D spectral and 3D structure similarities. To effectively assess the performance, we
                rigorously match and evaluate the detected and reference trees in a one-to-one relationship. A
                qualitative evaluation at three different sites shows that the proposed method is able to detect
                individual trees at different regions with high accuracy.â€‹</p>
